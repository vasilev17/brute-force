# Brute Force
Brute Force is a proof-of-concept Windows Forms utility written entirely in C#, aiming to demonstrate how a desktop program can automate a brute-force password attack against any Windows GUI login dialog.

## Installation
- In order to run the algorithm itself you need to open the *"E2Pass.sln"* file.
- If you run the *"Login.exe"* a demo login window will open. You can use this window to test the brute force algorithm.

## Usage
Drag and drop the crosshair onto the password field and the login button:
